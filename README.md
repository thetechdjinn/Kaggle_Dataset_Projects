# Kaggle Datasets Projects

This repository is actually multiple educational projects (or will be) using Kaggle Datasets.  

These are projects taken up to learn and improve my Machine Learning skills and I am sharing
them so that others may learn from my personal efforts.

***Note:*** *These projects do not necessarily mean these are the professional and proper way to
handle these projects.  They were done for learning purposes only even if they may contain some
more advanced methods*

### Fitness Classification Dataset

About the Dataset Project:

This project is based on what was learned from the DataCamp Supervised Learning with 
Scikit-Learn course.   While taking this course isn't necessary to learn from this
repository, it can be helpful to better understand the codebase and processes.
